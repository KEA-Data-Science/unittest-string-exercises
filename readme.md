# Basic String Unit Tests exercises
Fill in the code in the methods of the StringExercises class so the tests in the StringExercisesTest class will pass.

The test class is already created and can be found in test -> java -> kea.clbo -> StringExerciseTest

If you run the tests now they all fail.

Your job is to read the tests and afterwards create the right code for the methods in this StringExercises class.
